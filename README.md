# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning algorithms such as **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest**.  
It uses the **Heart Disease dataset** from Kaggle and is implemented in **Python** with **Scikit-Learn (sklearn)**.

## 📊 Dataset
Dataset used: [Heart Disease Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction)

- Total records: 918
- Features: Age, Sex, ChestPainType, RestingBP, Cholesterol, etc.
- Target: `HeartDisease` (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

---

## ⚙️ Steps Involved
1. Imported the dataset (`heart.csv`)
2. Handled categorical data using **One Hot Encoding**
3. Split the data into training and validation sets (80/20)
4. Trained models:
   - **Decision Tree Classifier** → Accuracy: **86%**
   - **Random Forest Classifier** → Accuracy: **87.5%**
5. Compared model performance and plotted accuracy graphs.
